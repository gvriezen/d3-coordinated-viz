		<h3> Datasets </h3>
		<h4> Medicare Beneficiaries (%): Medicare beneficiaries as a percent of total population (2015) </h4>
		<h4>Hospital Beds Per 1000 People: represents staffed beds for community hospitals, which make up 85% of all hospitals (2014) </h4>
		<h4> Need Met in HPSAs (%): HPSAs are Health Professional Shortage Areas which are designations given to identify various areas or groups of people that currently lack health professionals. This designation is given if there is a low number of health professionals compared to the population. For primary medical care, (as this data represents - other HPSA categories include dental and mental health) the ratio of providers to population has to be at least 3,500 to 1. This data is showing the percent of need in HPSAs which is determined by dividing physicians available by the amount of physicians needed to remove the HPSA designation (2014) </h4>
		<h4>Cost Barriers (%): the percent of adults who have not visited a doctor in the past year due to cost (2014)</h4>
		<h4>  Medicare Spending Per Enrollee: Medicare spending on health products and services (2009)</h4>
